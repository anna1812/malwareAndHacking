                <h2>What is malware?</h2>
                <p>Malware, shorthand for malicious software, is software that is designed to damage or control computer systems. Malware typically consists of code developed by cyberattackers and is usually delivered in the form of a link or file that requires the user to click or open in order to exercute the malware. There are a number of malware variants including viruses, <a href=https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/ransomware>ransomware</a> and spyware. </p>
                <br>
                <h2>What can malware do?</h2>
                <p>Malware delivers it's damage to a device in a number of ways. From demanding a ransom from the user to stealing personal data from the device, the cybercriminals behind their malware are becoming more and more sophisticated with ways of extracting data from users. Listed below are definitions of some of the most common malware types.</p>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <h2>Types of malware:</h2>
                <h3>Virus</h3>
                <p>Viruses are the most common type of malware, in simple terms, viruses attach their malicious code to clean code in the user's device. This then waits for the user to innocently execute the code (e.g. clicking on a link or opening a file); allowing the virus to replicate itself. From here, the virus spreads quickly and widely, causing severe damage to the functionality of other core systems in the device, corrupting files and locking users out of their own device; rendering it practically useless to the user. Since viruses normally replicates itself through a contained, executable code, user input needs to do something to get rid of it.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Worms</h3>
                <p>Worms get their name from the way they operate, replicating itself and 'eating' through the data on a device. Worms work to destroy data and files on a device until it is empty; or until they are stopped. They also spread extremely quickly and, once finishing on one device, quickly spreading to another. Unlike a virus, worms spread without the needing execution of code (by themselves).</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Spyware</h3>
                <p>As its name suggests, spyware is designed to watch, or spy, on what a user is doing. Hiding in the background of a device, spyware will collect information without the user knowing, such as credit card details, passwords and other sensitive information. This malware is usually broken into four categories: <a href=https://www.malwarebytes.com/adware>adware</a>, system monitors, tracking and trojans.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Trojans</h3>
                <p>Trojans is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software. Acting discreetly, it will breach security by creating backdoors that give other malware variants easy access. Aside from this it is also used to discover financial information, take over device resources, and occasionally creating a Denail of service attack (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack>DDos Attacks</a> ). </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Ransomware</h3>
                <p>Ransomware, also known as scareware, usually comes with a heavy price. It is a form of malware that locks you out of your computer and practically blackmails the user in intent of receiving payment. Typically, when a device is infected with ransomware, the user will see a pop-up outlining terms. Even if the user pays these terms, there is still no assurance of being completely free of the malware from locking them out again.</p>
